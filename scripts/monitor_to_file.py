This module is for cron jobs. It stores data in a data.txt file for retrieval
from conky using:

    ${execpi 5 cat ~/.conky/scripts/data.txt}

To activate a cron job for this, issue the command crontab -e and edit your
cron jobs. Recommended configuration is to execute every 5 minutes, like
this:

    */5 * * * * python ~/.conky/scripts/monitor_to_file.py
