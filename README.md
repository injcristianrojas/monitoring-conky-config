# Conky configuration for monitoring purposes

## Intro

As part of my everyday work, I must monitor different systems and software mainly
using Nagios. But Nagios is pretty uncomfortable most of the time, and, let's face it,
[nobody really checks those Nagios e-mails](http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/post/39118334785/carefully-examining-nagios-emails).

So I saw in [Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/) an opportunity to monitor things a
little better, on-screen. I took some freely available conky scripts, and I tried them
on my Ubuntu GNOME Shell Remix machine. Hope this works for you too.

## Quick Start

First, clone the repo in your home directory under the `.conky` directory. If you have
that directory already, back it up.

    git clone git@github.com:injcristianrojas/monitoring-conky-config.git ~/.conky

In order to use Conky, you must have a ~/.conkyrc file. To make things a little easier,
create a symbolic link:

    ln -s .conky/conkyrc ~/.conkyrc

You're almost ready. Now make a copy of the example service definitions file called
`service_defs.py` and you will have three examples up and running:

    cd .conky/scripts
    cp service_defs_example.py service_defs.py

Run `conky` and you're good to go.

## A little deeper

The last lines of the conkyrc file call a python module, which monitors service
commands:

    ${execpi 10 python ~/.conky/scripts/monitor.py mon1}
    ${execpi 10 python ~/.conky/scripts/monitor.py mon2}
    ${execpi 10 python ~/.conky/scripts/monitor.py mon3}

You can define the services to bo monitored and their check types in the
`service_definitions` dictionary on the `service_defs.py` file. Each service
definition must be created as follows:

    'MON_ID': {
    	'command': 'COMMAND_TO_BE_EXECUTED',
    	'name': 'NAME_TO_APPEAR',
    	'type': 'CHECK_TYPE'
    }

The parameters are the following:

* `MON_ID`: Service ID. Must match the one indicated as the argument of the
`monitor.py` call in `conkyrc` (`mon1`, `mon2`, `mon3`...).
* `COMMAND_TO_BE_EXECUTED`: Command to be executed by the service.
* `NAME_TO_APPEAR`: Name that will appear in the conky display for this service.
* `CHECK_TYPE`: Depending on `COMMAND_TO_BE_EXECUTED`'s exit code it can display status
information depending on one of the following types:
  * `TYPE_UP_DOWN`: If the service command has an exit code of 0, displays `UP`.
  Otherwise, it displays `DOWN`.
  * `TYPE_NAGIOS`: This type of display is based on the Nagios style of status
  definitions. It displays `OK` if the command has an exit code of 0, `WARNING`
  if it is 1, and `CRITICAL` if it is 2.


## Caveats

* The **Wireless Networking Stats** section in the conkyrc file is based on my
laptop's configuration. Change them from `eth1` to whatever your main
networking interface is in your machine.
